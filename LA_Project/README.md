# A mini project using data from Los Angeles City Data Portal

## Data used
[Listing of Active Businesses](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Listing-of-Active-Businesses/6rrh-rzua)
[Business Closures 20130701 - Present](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Business-Closures-20130701-Present/sg5j-gp4v)  

In part 1, I use ggmap package in R to produce a heatmap of active business in Los Angeles region and investigate how businesses distribute geographically.
In part 2, I use dplyr package in R to merge active business and business closure data, identify industrial sectors with highest and least closures since 2013.
