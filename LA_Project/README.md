### Brief Summary
In part 1, I use ggmap package in R to produce a heatmap of active business in Los Angeles region and investigate how businesses distribute geographically. <br /> [report](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/LA_Project/Project_Part_1_final.pdf) & [code](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/LA_Project/Project_Part_1_code_final.R)
<br />
<br />
In part 2, I use dplyr package in R to merge active business and business closure data, identify industrial sectors with highest and least closures since 2013.  <br /> [report](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/LA_Project/Project_Part_2_Final.pdf) & [code](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/LA_Project/Project_Part_2_code_final.R)
