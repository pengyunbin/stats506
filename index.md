## Welcome to my page for STATS 506 Statistical Computing



### Homework 2 dplyr, multidimensional scaling, and Monte Carlo
1. [Problem 1](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q1) uses **dplyr package** to analysize RECS data about roof types of residential building in different states. 
2. [Problem 2](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q2) performs **text cleaning and multidimensional scaling** on a study of interaction between animals. 
3. [Problem 3](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q3) uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate \pi.
4. [Problem 4](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q4) uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to compare 2 different ways of computing confidence interval, one via **bootstrap** and one via robust estimator.
