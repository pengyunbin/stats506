## Welcome to my page for STATS 506 Statistical Computing

### Assignment 1 STATA
1. [Problem 1a](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/hw1_problem1a.do) uses STATA to convert data between long and wide format. [Problem 1b](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/hw1_problem1b.do) and [Problem 1c](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/hw1_problem1c.do) use STATA to perform logistic and robust regression. 
2. [Problem 2](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/hw1_problem_2.do) uses STATA to perform data analysis on RECS dataset, I will use other computing languages to perform the same analysis in subsequent assignments (dplyr in Assignment 2, data.table in Assignment 3). 
3. [Problem 3](https://github.com/pengyunbin/stats506/blob/master/hw1_problem_3.do) uses STATA to analysis National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, in particular how different demographic groups may have different results in audiometry test. (Note: This data set will be used again in Assignment 4 but with SAS)

### Assignment 2 dplyr, multidimensional scaling, and Monte Carlo
1. [Problem 1](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q1) uses **dplyr package** to analysize RECS data about roof types of residential building in different states. 
2. [Problem 2](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q2) performs **text cleaning and multidimensional scaling** on a study of interaction between animals. 
3. [Problem 3](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q3) uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate pi.
4. [Problem 4](https://pengyunbin.github.io/stats506/hw2_q4) uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to compare 2 different ways of computing confidence interval, one via **bootstrap** and one via robust estimator.
